# 🧠 LBP-Based Face Recognition (Python)

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **August 2023** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This Python project implements a **facial recognition system** using the **Local Binary Pattern (LBP)** algorithm. It processes a dataset of **40 individuals**, each with **10 facial images** from different angles. The system supports both **full-image analysis** and **region-based segmentation** (dividing each image into 9 zones) to improve recognition accuracy.

The system includes:

- 🧠 **LBP Feature Extraction** – Applied to full image and 3x3 grid regions  
- 🧪 **Face Classification** – Compare extracted features for identity prediction  
- 🗂️ **Dataset Handling** – Supports structured datasets with multiple subjects  
- 📊 **Accuracy Evaluation** – 98% Measure performance across different configurations  
- 🧩 **Modular Codebase** – Easy to extend with other descriptors or classifiers

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was developed to explore **texture-based facial recognition**, **feature engineering**, and **dataset-driven evaluation** in Python. It reflects my interest in building intelligent systems for pattern analysis and biometric identification.
